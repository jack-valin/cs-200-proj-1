Sprint 1(Monday, Tuesday):
David:
committed the initial push with header & cpp files along with a password checker
Jack:
Thomas:
	Created the first print to file function, may need more but
		they will just be copy paste
	Created the read from file function, again, may need more
		but it will just be copy paste if we do
	Worked on the user class and header files
	Added the login menu, the credentials are:
		admin
		rosebud
	These are just to test and will be taken out later
Sam:


Sprint 2(Wednesday, Thursday):
David:
Jack:
	Corrected a couple of minor typos
	Fleshed out the User class a little more
		Created accessors
		Filled in constructor
	Set up more of the Client class
		Began fleshing out many of its functions, but need to define the account class before much more can be done
		Fixed setUserID function so it merges int and string properly (used #6 in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/191757/how-to-concatenate-a-stdstring-and-an-int/900035#900035)
	Created skeleton for the account class
	Troubleshooting so my client-class branch compiles and runs
